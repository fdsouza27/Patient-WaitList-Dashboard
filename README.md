# Patient Waitlist Analysis Dashboard
The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing patient waitlist data across various specialties and types of stays. It uses historical data from January 2018 to March 2021 and provides detailed insights into trends, bifurcations, and key metrics. 

### Overview

The dashboard includes the following features:

1) Total Waitlist Comparison: Displays the overall count of patients in the waitlist, broken down by year and case type (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, day case).
2) Waitlist Bifurcation: Segments the data by case type to provide a clear understanding of distribution among different patient categories.
3) Monthly Trend Analysis: Highlights trends in patient counts over time, comparing day case/inpatients versus outpatients.
4) Time Band vs. Age Profile Analysis: Explores wait times across various age groups and time bands (e.g., 0-3 months, 18+ months).
5) Top 5 Specialties by Waitlist Volume
6) Detailed Specialty and Type of Stay Analysis: Provides a granular view of patient data categorized by specialty, type of stay, and age profile.
